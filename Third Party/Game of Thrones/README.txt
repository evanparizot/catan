# Summary

Catan set made by Glowforge and is filed under the Creative Commons Attribution. It is not intended to replace the official Catan game produced by Mayfair, and a copy of said game will need to be purchased in order to have all pieces required for gameplay.

Glowforge digital files: https://glowforge.com/laser-cut-catan-board
Official Mayfair Catan board game: http://www.catan.com/

----------------------------------

This version you are downloading was compiled by Carlotta4th and has minor changes from the Glowforge files, as follows:

-Pieces added to expand the set from 2-4 players to 4-6 players
-Center circles given a larger lip
-Sheep tile inverted so outside etch is lighter
-Various cleanup, some lines thickened others reduced, etc.
-Tile sizes scaled down slightly
-Cut lines recreated and are now .001 thickness

# How I Designed This

My CATAN digital files are mix-and-match to make your own custom set. All purchaseable CATAN digital files are available in my etsy shop, and any free files (including the default center tiles) are available through thingiverse here.
