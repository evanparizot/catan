# Settlers of Catan | GOT
This is a loosely Game of Thrones themed [Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/) (Catan) board meant to be an accessory to the base game and expansion. The inspiration for this project was a [post made on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6wccx6/i_made_a_game_of_thrones_themed_catan_board/), which is where artwork and files were primarily sourced.

# Build Details
### Design & Files
The artwork and line work for this project were primarily sourced from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6wccx6/i_made_a_game_of_thrones_themed_catan_board/). This project takes no credit for the designs used; the primary work performed was to port file formats to something that can be used by the laser cutter used to make this project.

The designs were converted using a mixture of Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. Designs were ported to a `dxf` file format; the required file format used for importing in the laser cutter software.

### Wood Used
- Borders/Desert: Cherry
- Brick: Padauck
- Wood: Walnut
- Wheat: Yellowheart
- Sheep/Horse: Hard Maple
- Stone/Ore: Wenge

### Fabrication
All the wood was sourced from a local saw mill. It was bought as 4/4 stock and resawn to .25" thick. From here, all designs were cut into the wood sheets. Several passes were made in order to get the desired effects:
1.  The first pass was a raster engraving over the face of the wood. This creates a shading like effect, best seen on the Horse (Sheep) tile. 
2. The second pass was an engraving of both thin line parts of the design, as well as to clean up the edges of the rastering. 
3. The last part was an actual cut through the entire material to create individual tile pieces.

From here all pieces were sanded with a random orbital sander with progressive grits of 120 to 220. After sanding, pieces were cleaned with compressed air as well as mineral spirits to remove all remaining sawdust. To finish, a clear coat was applied.

For the tile, card, and other holders, thin plywood was used. All designs were made in inkscape and cut out on the laser cutter.
